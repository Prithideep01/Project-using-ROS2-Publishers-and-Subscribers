# Project-using-ROS2-Publishers-and-Subscribers
It is a mini project using the publisher and subscriber nodes, interacting with each other.   

Project Topic:- Consider a mobile robot moving at a constant speed. The rpm of wheel of the robot is known using the encoder's placed at the wheels. The task is to publish the rpm to the subscriber node through a topic named as 'RPM'. The subscriber node uses the rpm and calculates the speed in meter per second (m/s) which is further published to a 'speed' topic.
